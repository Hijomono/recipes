Ingredients:
 - 7 biscuits
 - 1 banana
 - 7 pieces of a chocolate bar

Directions:
 1. Divide the banana into 9 pieces, eat the end ones.
 
 2. Place the remaining banana pieces on the biscuits, and the chocolate pieces over them.
 
 3. Microwave for around 30" and wait pressing lightly the chocolate against the bananas to help its melting, until the original chocolate pieces shape is barely noticeable.

 4. Introduce in the fridge and wait at least two hours. Enjoy.
